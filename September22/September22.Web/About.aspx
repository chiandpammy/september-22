        Pamela's Story...
    </h2>
    <p>
        It was the summer of 2002, on June 10th, the first day of the second summer session.  I was taking an extra computer science class to try to graduate on-time.  Chi was just getting in another technical class under his belt, but I didn't know him then.  I walked into the room and took a seat in the front row, oblivious to whomever was sitting behind me.  At the end of class, I walked out in my heels and a skirt with no umbrella... only to find it raining outside.

        Welcome to our wedding website. Thank you for visiting. We hope that you'll

        It's hard to believe that we've been engaged for over 6 months now. We have
        been so busy planning the wedding that the time has just flown by. It's been
        a lot of fun so far, and there's much more to get done before the big day
        arrives.
    </p>

        couple you know and love, please visit "Our Story". To find our engagement
